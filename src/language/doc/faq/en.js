    _2_6_des:
      "When using a proxy, you can specify the lifespan of the IP or use it throughout the IP's validity period. Since the proxy is a residential proxy, the lifespan of a residential proxy ranges from a few hours to a few days.",

    _2_7_des:
      'You can switch IP addresses in three ways:\n(1) Re - select an IP address channel from the obtained proxy list.\n(2) Call the dedicated API for switching IPs. For details, please refer to the API documentation.\n(3) Customize the proxy authentication username:\nThe authentication user format of IpStar is usually "user - ipstr - 0 - country - N".\nHere is a real example: "u20247cwjfp - 6Kv3RsAYBc - 0 - BR - N".\nYou can change the second segment "ipstr" to another random string to change the IP address. At the same time, you can change the fourth segment "country" to another country code to switch countries.

    _2_10_des:
      "Theoretically, you can use residential proxies for any operation that a regular proxy can perform. The undetectability of residential proxies makes them ideal for media streaming, online shopping, and data scraping on websites that block regular proxies.\nConsidering potential risks, IpStar prohibits accessing sensitive websites through proxy IP addresses. These websites include websites in high - risk areas, government websites, certain specific websites, etc. When you access these websites through the IpStar proxy, you will receive an error message indicating that the target website is blocked. If you have any questions, please consult our online customer service.",
